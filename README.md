# Introduction 
This is a lab that I did to explore several points when provisioning cloud native applications. The application should move every single line of log files from an on premises folder, where they are generated, to a database where itÂ´s possible to query log lines. The files can be generated any time, any quantity and the application should process the files as soon as they are generated. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
